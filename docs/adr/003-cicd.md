# ADR 003: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
VintuSure needs a robust CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and reliability while automating the deployment process. The pipeline should include comprehensive testing, security scanning, and performance monitoring.

## Decision
We have implemented a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with the following components:

1. Quality Checks
   - Linting with ESLint
   - Type checking with TypeScript
   - Unit testing with Vitest
   - Code coverage reporting with Codecov

2. Security Scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning with Snyk
   - npm audit for package vulnerabilities
   - Secret scanning with Gitleaks
   - Security policy enforcement

3. Visual Regression Testing
   - Storybook visual testing
   - Lighthouse CI for performance and accessibility
   - Cross-browser testing with Playwright

4. End-to-End Testing
   - Playwright E2E test suite
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Test report generation

5. Deployment
   - Automated deployment to Firebase
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Preview deployments for pull requests

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  quality:
    name: Quality Checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Lint
      - Type check
      - Unit tests
      - Coverage reporting

  security:
    name: Security Scan
    steps:
      - Snyk vulnerability scan
      - npm audit
      - Secret scanning

  visual-regression:
    name: Visual Regression Tests
    steps:
      - Storybook tests
      - Lighthouse CI
      - Cross-browser testing

  e2e:
    name: End-to-End Tests
    steps:
      - Playwright tests
      - Report generation

  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: [quality, security, visual-regression, e2e]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - Firebase deployment
```

### Lighthouse CI Configuration
```javascript
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    assert: {
      preset: 'lighthouse:recommended',
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'categories:accessibility': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        // ... performance budgets and requirements
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automated quality assurance
- Early detection of issues
- Consistent deployment process
- Performance monitoring
- Security vulnerability detection
- Visual regression prevention

### Negative
- Increased build time
- More complex pipeline maintenance
- Additional infrastructure costs
- Need for secret management

## Security Considerations
- Secure secret storage in GitHub
- Limited deployment permissions
- Vulnerability scanning thresholds
- Branch protection rules

## Performance Impact
- Parallel job execution
- Caching of dependencies
- Selective test execution
- Optimized build process

## Notes
- Regular pipeline maintenance required
- Monitor build times and costs
- Update security scanning rules
- Review test coverage thresholds
