# ADR 001: Accessibility Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
VintuSure needs to be accessible to all users, including those who rely on keyboard navigation and screen readers. We need to implement accessibility features that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards while maintaining a good user experience for all users.

## Decision
We have decided to implement the following accessibility features:

1. Keyboard Navigation
   - Created a KeyboardContext to track keyboard vs. mouse usage
   - Implemented a withKeyboardNavigation HOC for list components
   - Added focus management for interactive elements
   - Implemented keyboard shortcuts for common actions

2. Screen Reader Support
   - Added ARIA labels and roles to all interactive elements
   - Implemented proper heading hierarchy
   - Added descriptive text for form controls
   - Ensured proper focus management

3. Visual Accessibility
   - Implemented high contrast mode support
   - Ensured proper color contrast ratios
   - Added focus indicators for keyboard users
   - Made sure text is resizable

4. Technical Implementation
   - Used React Context for keyboard navigation state
   - Created reusable HOCs for keyboard navigation
   - Implemented ARIA attributes consistently
   - Added proper role attributes to custom components

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved accessibility for keyboard users
- Better screen reader support
- Consistent keyboard navigation across the application
- Reusable components for accessibility features
- Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Negative
- Additional development overhead
- More complex component implementation
- Need for thorough testing across different assistive technologies

## Implementation Details

### Keyboard Navigation Context
```typescript
interface KeyboardContextType {
  isKeyboardUser: boolean;
  setIsKeyboardUser: (value: boolean) => void;
}
```

### Higher-Order Component
```typescript
export function withKeyboardNavigation<P extends WithKeyboardNavigationProps>(
  WrappedComponent: ComponentType<P>
) {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### ARIA Implementation
- Used semantic HTML elements where possible
- Added ARIA labels for non-semantic elements
- Implemented proper focus management
- Added keyboard shortcuts

## Notes
- Regular accessibility audits should be performed
- Screen reader testing should be part of QA process
- Keyboard navigation testing should be included in E2E tests
