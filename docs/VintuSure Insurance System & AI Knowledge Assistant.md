## **About VintuSure**

**VintuSure AI** is an internal assistant designed to help insurance agents and staff find instant, accurate answers across all types of policies — whether vehicle, home, health, or business insurance.

* Your core insurance system will handle essential business logic like policy management, claims processing, and billing.

* VintuSure AI acts as a smart knowledge engine that reads and understands your internal documents, then responds intelligently to staff queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

* This AI assistant works as a separate backend service that your insurance system can call via APIs whenever it needs fast, precise answers from your vast internal documentation — without the core system needing to understand how those answers are generated.

### **Real-Life Example**

If an agent asks:  
 **“Does my insurance cover phone theft?”**  
 The AI assistant will:

1. Find the relevant policy document

2. Locate the section about phone theft

3. Reply with a clear, accurate answer:  
    *"Yes, your policy covers phone theft up to K3,000 under the personal property section."*

It’s like combining Google search with ChatGPT — but only searching your own documents.
