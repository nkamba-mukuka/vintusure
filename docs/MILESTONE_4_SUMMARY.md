const validation = validateAndSanitizeQuery(query);

// Enhanced security logging
await logSecurityEvent('rag_query_request', userId, details);
```

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Enhanced data validation
function isValidPolicyData() {
  return request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['customerId', 'type', 'status', 'startDate', 'endDate', 'premium']) &&
    request.resource.data.type in ['comprehensive', 'third_party'] &&
    request.resource.data.status in ['active', 'expired', 'cancelled', 'pending'];
}

// Improved access control
match /policies/{policyId} {
  allow read: if hasValidRole();
  allow create: if hasValidRole() && isValidPolicyData() &&
    request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
}
```
