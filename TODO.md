# üöÄ VintuSure AI Insurance System Milestones

## Milestone 1: Landing Page Development ‚úÖ
**Objective**: Implement the VintuSure landing page (vintusure.com) with clear navigation for agents and customers.

### Tasks:
- [x] Update the landing page UI, where there is a white background put a blurred background, resembling apple's liquid glass.
- [x] Implement "I'm an Agent" button linking to /login (login page) if the current user is not authenticated, but if authenticated just show a dashboard button.
- [x] Implement "I'm a Customer" button linking to /explore (external tools).

## Milestone 2: Internal Use (Agent & Employee) System Development ‚úÖ
**Objective**: Develop the secure internal system for insurance agents and employees with full access and AI assistance.

### Tasks:
- [x] Make sure that every route/page requires a user to be authenticated to access the links/pages.
- [x] Develop full visibility features for customer profiles in the customer folder in the components directory, policies as well in the policies folder in the components directory, claims in the claims folder in the components directory, and any other data sensitive data and make sure that a user can only access data that corresponds with their userId.
- [x] Integrate context-aware AI assistant for agents (e.g., "Need help creating a claim?" pops up on the claims page in the claims folder in the components directory).
- [x] Implement AI functionality to answer agent-specific questions (e.g., "When is Mukuka Nkamba's policy expiring?") implement this on the dashboard page in the dashboard.tsx file in the dashboard folder in the components directory, keep the topbar and sidebar components.
- [x] Develop features for agents to update records, process claims, and manage policies.
- [x] Integrate friendly tabs that show helpful suggestions of the important and vital tasks like creating policies e.t.c, implement this on the dashboard as well.
- [x] Build a comprehensive dashboard including all tools needed for day-to-day insurance operations.

## Milestone 3: External Use (Customer & Visitor) System Development ‚úÖ
**Objective**: Create a prompt and read-only external platform for customers and potential clients to browse information and connect with agents.

### Tasks:
- [x] Set up /explore or /public routes with no login required. Create an explore.tsx component that uses the already existing RAG functionality.
- [x] Develop sections for browsing insurance product info, FAQs, and general policy overviews.
- [x] Ensure no access to download sensitive documents or quotes.
- [x] Implement display of agent contact information (Name, Phone number üìû, Email ‚úâÔ∏è, Location map üó∫Ô∏è) for customer inquiries.
- [x] Integrate a general AI assistant for product-related questions, without access to personal data(use the existing RAG functionality here as well).
- [x] Design a simple, clean UI focused on educating and connecting customers to agents.

## Milestone 4: System Security & Efficiency Review ‚úÖ
**Objective**: Ensure the system adheres to security protocols, maintains efficiency, and provides a user-friendly experience for both internal and external users.

### Tasks:
- [x] Conduct a security audit to confirm sensitive data remains internal.
- [x] Evaluate system efficiency, ensuring agents have full tools and customers get easy information.
- [x] Review user-friendliness, verifying tailored AI help for agents and simple guidance for customers.
