# VintuSure Frontend Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
VintuSure is a modern Motor Third Party Insurance management system built with Firebase and Vertex AI integration. The system handles the complete lifecycle of insurance policies in Zambia.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- TanStack Query for Firebase data management
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Storybook

## Development Strategy
1. Build UI components and integrate with Firebase
2. Implement Firebase Authentication and role-based access
