# VintuSure Frontend Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
VintuSure is a modern Motor Third Party Insurance management system built with Firebase and Vertex AI integration. The system handles the complete lifecycle of insurance policies in Zambia.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- TanStack Query for Firebase data management
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Storybook

## Development Strategy
1. Build UI components and integrate with Firebase
2. Implement Firebase Authentication and role-based access
3. Set up Firestore collections and queries
4. Implement Cloud Storage for documents
5. Later: Integrate Vertex AI for intelligent features

## Firebase Collection Structure

```
src/
├── lib/
│   ├── firebase/
│   │   ├── auth.ts
│   │   ├── firestore.ts
│   │   ├── storage.ts
│   │   └── functions.ts
│   └── utils/
│       ├── permissions.ts
│       └── formatters.ts
├── types/
│   └── index.ts       (Firestore document interfaces)
└── components/
    └── firebase/      (Firebase-specific components)
```

## Important Considerations

### 1. Firebase Security
- [ ] Proper security rules for Firestore
- [ ] Storage access control
- [ ] Role-based access implementation
- [ ] API key protection

### 2. Data Structure
- [ ] Efficient Firestore queries
- [ ] Proper indexing
- [ ] Data validation
- [ ] Real-time updates optimization

### 3. Performance
- [ ] Implement proper caching
- [ ] Optimize Firebase reads/writes
- [ ] Lazy loading for large collections
- [ ] Efficient file uploads

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Firebase operation errors
- [ ] Network issues
- [ ] Authentication errors
- [ ] File upload failures

## Future Vertex AI Integration
- [ ] Document embedding for RAG
- [ ] Question answering system
- [ ] Premium calculation assistance
- [ ] Risk assessment

---

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Firebase hosting configuration
- [ ] Environment variables setup
- [ ] Build optimization
- [ ] Security rules deployment
- [ ] Cloud Functions deployment
- [ ] Monitoring setup

## Notes
- This is a Firebase-first implementation. All data operations should use Firebase SDKs directly instead of REST APIs.
- The system will be extended with Vertex AI capabilities in the future phase.
- Each milestone should be completed with the specified checklist before moving to the next milestone.
- Both branches should maintain clear separation of concerns while ensuring proper integration points.
